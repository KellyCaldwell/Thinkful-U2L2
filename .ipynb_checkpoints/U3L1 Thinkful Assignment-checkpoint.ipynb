I can easily see that there aren’t any extreme values that would tamper with the result. I would also pick standard deviation over variance and standard error. This is because standard deviation is expressed in the problem’s original units. Since we aren’t doing any further calculations, that is a more useful figure. Additionally, in this problem, the sample is also the total population; consequently, the standard error isn’t helpful."
